Biography
======
Since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by the world of computers, probably because I got into video-games just like many of us! My dad used to tell me "You should be making these games and let the others play them." Fortunately or unfortunately I didn't get into game development, but turned out to be a computer scientist newbie!

I studied **Mathematics/Physics** in high-school and graduated with a B.Sc. in **Computer (Software) Engineering** from [KHU](https://khu.ac.ir/en). I'm currently a Ph.D. student in **Computer Science** at [GSU](https://gsu.edu), and a graduate research assistant in [DMLab](https://dmlab.cs.gsu.edu), under the supervision of [Dr. Angryk](https://cas.gsu.edu/profile/rafal-angryk/), conducting research in building data-driven forecasting techniques for extreme space weather events.

In my leisure time, I enjoy playing basketball, hiking, playing the guitar, and going to the gym.
