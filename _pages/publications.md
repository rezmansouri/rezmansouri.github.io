Ehsani M., **Mansouri R.**, *ResearchSquare - Preprint*

 Inspired by the Girvan-Newman community detection algorithm, this paper presents a new approach, called _BridgeCut_, in which the negative edges, sorted by the betweenness measure, are determined in a constructive algorithm as the bridge set between the two parts.

### [2] Load Balancing in Cloud, Fog Computing and Convergence of Fog and Cloud â€“ A Survey
Mirtaheri S. L., Azari Jafari M., Greco S., Arianian E. and **Mansouri R.**, *Journal of Information Systems and Telecommunication (2023)*<sup> accepted </sup>

This paper reviews and investigates the modern and diverse load balancing aspects of fog and cloud computing systems. We also categorize the load balancing algorithms in cloud and fog computing: meta-heuristic algorithms, heuristic algorithms, learning algorithms, and customized algorithms. We propose different research classes about the algorithm's type, objectives, simulation tools, and so forth.

### <a href="https://en.civilica.com/doc/1366047/" target="_blank">[3] A New Approach to Balanced Partitioning of Signed Networks</a>
Ehsani M., **Mansouri R.**, *14<sup>th</sup> International Conference of Iranian Operations Research Society (ICORS 2021)*<sup> published</sup>

The early version of our 2022 paper (BridgeCut), this paper presents a new approach to partition an imbalanced signed network into two near-balanced sub-networks. We further supplemented the results of this work with additional investigations on some measures to evaluate signed links' properties in relevance to their position and role in the whole structure of a network in the _BridgeCut_ paper.
