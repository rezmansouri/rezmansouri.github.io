Granules are small cellular structures that populate the solar photosphere and are formed by the dynamic behavior of convection cells. This constant motion generates an evolving pattern of diverse granule types and intergranular regions across the photosphere. Understanding this microscale phenomenon by accurately identifying and classifying the underlying structures is crucial to advance the knowledge of the fundamental physical processes driving solar dynamics. In this study, we leverage images from the IMaX instrument on the SUNRISE balloon-borne telescope, along with their corresponding ground truth masks, to conduct a comparative evaluation of various neural semantic segmentation models. Our best-performing methodology achieves an average mIoU of 0.41 and an average dice coefficient of 0.53 among the classes. Furthermore, we applied the best performing model to high-resolution images from the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) telescope, generating preliminary annotations to facilitate future analysis, making this the first application of these techniques to data from DKIST.

### <a href="https://en.civilica.com/doc/1366047/" target="_blank">[2] A New Approach to Balanced Partitioning of Signed Networks</a>
Ehsani M., **Mansouri R.**, *14<sup>th</sup> International Conference of Iranian Operations Research Society (ICORS 2021)*<sup> published</sup>

The early version of our 2022 paper (BridgeCut), this paper presents a new approach to partition an imbalanced signed network into two near-balanced sub-networks. We further supplemented the results of this work with additional investigations on some measures to evaluate signed links' properties in relevance to their position and role in the whole structure of a network in the _BridgeCut_ paper.

Ehsani M., **Mansouri R.**, *ResearchSquare - Preprint*

 Inspired by the Girvan-Newman community detection algorithm, this paper presents a new approach, called _BridgeCut_, in which the negative edges, sorted by the betweenness measure, are determined in a constructive algorithm as the bridge set between the two parts.
