About Me
======
Hi! I'm Reza, a computer science Ph.D. student at [Georgia State University](https://gsu.edu). I'm currently a research assistant in the [Data Mining Laboratory](https://dmlab.cs.gsu.edu) where I conduct research in predicting extreme space weather events using big data and data-driven analyses.

Research Interests
------
I am primarily interested in applying data mining techniques on visionary data to solve real-world problems. This essentially involves the accomponied use of computer vision algorithms along with machine learning techniques, and especially deep neural networks.
